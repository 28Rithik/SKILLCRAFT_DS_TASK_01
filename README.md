Hi there!
I'm Rithik CA, and this repository showcases my submission for Task 1 of the SkillCraft Technology Data Science Internship. In this task, I performed exploratory data analysis on a real-world population dataset to uncover meaningful insights using Python and data visualization libraries.

🌍 About the Dataset
I worked with the World Population Dataset, which includes demographic statistics of various countries as of 2022. The dataset captures a wide range of features such as:

🌐 Total population

📈 Yearly population change (%)

🧮 Population density

👶 Fertility rate

🎂 Median age

🏙️ Urban population share

🌏 Share of world population
... and more!

🧰 Tools & Libraries
This project was carried out using Python in a Jupyter Notebook environment, leveraging the following libraries:

pandas and numpy – For data cleaning and manipulation

matplotlib and seaborn – For data visualization and trend analysis

Jupyter Notebook – For documenting and presenting the analysis

🔍 What I Did – A Quick Walkthrough
1. 📊 Getting to Know the Data
I started by exploring the structure of the dataset, checking for missing values, and identifying the key columns necessary for the analysis.

2. 🧹 Data Cleaning
I handled missing/null values, corrected data types, and ensured the dataset was consistent and ready for visualization.

3. 📈 Data Visualization
I created multiple visualizations to understand the data patterns:

Bar plots – To display the top 10 most populous countries

Heatmap – To analyze correlations between variables like fertility rate, median age, and migration

Histograms and boxplots – To explore the distribution and identify outliers

Stacked bar charts – To compare urban population with total population across regions

💡 Key Takeaways
Population Concentration: A small group of countries account for the majority of the world’s population.

Fertility vs Age: Countries with higher fertility rates generally have lower median ages.

Urbanization Trends: Urbanized countries show higher population densities.

Notable Outliers: Migration rates and fertility rates vary significantly among countries.

🎯 Conclusion
This EDA task provided valuable experience in working with real-world data. I strengthened my skills in data cleaning, visualization, and storytelling through numbers. Understanding global population trends was not only insightful but also reinforced the importance of detailed data exploration before model building.

Thanks for stopping by and reviewing my work! 😊
